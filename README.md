# Project-Echo
Unified Audio Headset System

##Abstract

Project Echo serves as the next-generation audio headset for high-fidelity audio output.

Compared to conventional systems, which require separate codec hardware (blocks, audio cards) for handling audio processing, Project Echo merges the entire process into the headset. The codec hardware is virtually identical to high-quality audio cards, so no audio degradation is experienced from the process. The end result is an easy-to-use, compact system that performs equally as well as high-end conventional audio setups.

The target audience for Project Echo is the average consumer.
